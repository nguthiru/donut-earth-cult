    The donut earth cult

    Initiation - The Donut Earth Cult
                - Deny the earth being flat
                - Deny any other shape
                - Accept the earth is kind of a sphere, since its the 3d projection of a 4d donut in space
                - Accept the earth is a donut because it has two poles and one equator (the middle)
                - The donut earth is the only truth
                

    Beliefs

    - The earth is a donut
    - Donut hole is in 4d - the time dimension
    - The donut earth is a 3d projection of the 4d donut hole
    - The donut hole pulls in time like a vacuum allowing time  to flow
    - the flow of time is what we perceive as gravity
    - The bermuda triangle is at the donut hole
    - The bermuda triangle is a time warp
    - This explains why things get lost in the bermuda triangle
    - They are not lost in space, they are lost in time
    - since the hole is a time vacuum
