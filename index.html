      <h3>Initiation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Deny the earth being flat</li>
        <li>Deny any other shape</li>
        <li>
          Accept the earth is kind of a sphere, since its the 3d projection of a
          4d donut in space
        </li>
        <li>
          Accept the earth is a donut because it has two poles and one equator
          (the middle)
        </li>
        <li>The donut earth is the only truth</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Beliefs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The earth is a donut</li>
        <li>Donut hole is in 4d - the time dimension</li>
        <li>The donut earth is a 3d projection of the 4d donut hole</li>
        <li>
          The donut hole pulls in time like a vacuum allowing time to flow
        </li>
        <li>the flow of time is what we perceive as gravity</li>
        <li>The bermuda triangle is at the donut hole</li>
        <li>The bermuda triangle is a time warp</li>
        <li>This explains why things get lost in the bermuda triangle</li>
        <li>They are not lost in space, they are lost in time</li>
        <li>since the hole is a time vacuum</li>
      </ul>
